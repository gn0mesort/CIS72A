            <p>This is Ruby. She is the greatest dog to ever live. Ruby was a fawn pug with a big black stripe down her back. Ruby loved tennis balls more than anything else in the whole world. Whenever she was out for a walk she would look for (and usually find) a new tennis ball. She was kind to the tennis balls as long as they were outside but once she brought one home she destroyed it. She would play with each one so much that they would fall apart. It got so bad that I began having to look for more durable toys for her.</p>
            <p>On top of her tennis ball destroying prowess, Ruby was very talented. She was strong enough to drag me around by just here teeth (even though she never weighed more than 25 pounds). She also taught herself to throw her own toys so that she could play fetch when no one was home. Ruby's most important talent was knowing exactly when she was needed most. No matter where you were, or what you were doing Ruby knew if you needed her.</p>
            <p>Ruby's least favorite thing in the world was getting her claws clipped. If she got her way they would be allowed to just grow all the way around into her feet. She also hated baths with a passion. From the moment she got in all she wanted to do was escape. When she was finally let out she would run around drying herself off on everything. Even if I blow dried her</p>
            <p>Ruby died in 2014. She was around 15 years old.</p>
